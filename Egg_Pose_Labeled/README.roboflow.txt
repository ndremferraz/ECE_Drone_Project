The dataset includes 432 images.
Objects are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.97 percent of pixels
